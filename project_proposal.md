# ECE1724 Project Proposal
## Academic Event Ticketing and QR Code Check-in System

---

## Motivation
Organizing academic events such as Masterâ€™s and PhD defenses, conferences, seminars, and guest lectures often involves cumbersome manual processes. Event organizers rely on generic forms or email registrations, which lack real-time attendance tracking and efficient management tools. This leads to increased administrative workload, inefficiencies in handling attendee information, and a fragmented experience for organizers and participants.

Our project aims to develop a comprehensive web application to manage academic events. The application will enable online registration and attendance management. By integrating automated ticket generation and QR code-based check-in systems, the platform will streamline registration and check-in processes, enhance management efficiency, and reduce administrative burdens.

This project is worth pursuing because it creates a unified event management ecosystem that transforms fragmented manual processes into a seamless, automated workflow. It offers a tailored solution that improves attendance tracking accuracy, optimizes resource allocation, and enhances the overall experience for attendees and organizers.

Academic event organizers are the target users, such as staff members and lecturers who plan and manage events within academic institutions. A streamlined registration and check-in process will benefit attendees, including undergraduate and graduate students, faculty, and external guests.

Existing solutions, such as generic form builders and email-based registrations, provide basic functionality but lack integration and efficiency for comprehensive event management. Our platform overcomes these limitations by offering features such as user authentication, role-based access control, event creation and management tools, automated ticketing, QR code check-ins, and records archive, positioning it as a valuable tool for enhancing academic event management.

## Objective and Key Features
### Objective
Our project aims to develop a web-based platform specifically designed to streamline academic event management. The objectives include:
- Creating a role-based system to manage different user types and permissions.
- Implementing automated processes for event creation, registration, and attendance tracking.
- Developing a QR code-based check-in system.
- Enabling real-time interaction between participants during events via WebSockets.
- Ensuring secure file storage for event materials.

These objectives address the critical pain points identified in our motivation section while leveraging modern web technologies to create a cohesive solution for academic event management and ticket processing.

## Project Scope and Feasibility
With four team members and a 1-2 month timeframe, we have carefully scoped the project to prioritize core functionality. Our implementation will focus first on essential features (user management, event management, and QR code check-in) before progressing to advanced capabilities.

---


## Tentative Plan
Since we are using a non-separated front-end and back-end architecture, we will divide our team based on features:

| Team Member | Main Features | Advanced Feature |
|-------------|--------------|------------------|
| Ruoming Ren | User Registration and Login, Virtual Lounge, Attendance Monitoring | Real-time functionality |
| Zhaoyi Cheng | User Registration and Login, User Dashboard System and Profile Editing | User Authentication and Authorization |
| Ruoxi Yu | Event Registration | Google Calendar API Integration |
| Yige Tao | Event Browser and Event Management | File Storage |

This approach allows each member to take full ownership of specific product functionalities.
