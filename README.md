## Motivation

The main purpose of EventHub is to make academic event management easy and organized. The organizing of academic events envisaged as Master's and PhD defenses, conferences, seminars, and guest lectures, takes place using a cumbersome manual process. Most of the time, event organizers appeal to generic forms or email registrations, which do not have the functionalities of real-time attendance tracking, nor effective management tools. This leads to:

- Enhanced administrative workloads
- Inefficient management of participants' data
- Disrupted connectivity due to multiple systems used by organizers and attendees
- Ineffective organization of important event staff in dealing with case load
- Slow consideration of messages in real-time during events

Our platform addresses these pain points by providing a comprehensive solution that transforms fragmented manual processes into a seamless, automated workflow.

     ```

### 6. Implementation Best Practices

#### Code Style
This project uses ESLint and Prettier for code formatting. You can run the linter with:
```bash
npm run lint
```

For formatting, use:
```bash
npm run format
```

#### Database Schema Changes
After modifying the Prisma schema, run the following commands to update the database:
```bash
# Generate Prisma client (optional)
npm run prisma:generate

# Apply schema changes to the database
npm run prisma:migrate

# Add seed to the database
npm run prisma:seed
```

#### Component Development
- Use shadcn/ui components when possible for consistency
- Import components from the barrel file: `import { Button, Card } from '@/components/ui'`
- Use theme tokens from `@/lib/theme` for consistent styling
- Apply internationalization with the `t()` function
- Create reusable components in the `components` directory
- Use TypeScript for type safety

### 7. Internationalization (i18n)

The project uses a simple i18n solution with JSON-based locale files:

#### Structure
- Locale files are stored in the `locales/{language}` directory
- The main English locale file is at `locales/en/common.json`
- Text strings are organized in a nested structure by component/page

#### Usage
To use translations in your components:
```tsx
import t from '@/lib/i18n';

// Simple text translation
<h1>{t('dashboard.title')}</h1>

// With parameters
<p>{t('footer.copyright', { year: 2023 })}</p>
```

#### Adding New Translations
1. Add new strings to the `locales/en/common.json` file in the appropriate section
2. Use nested keys that reflect the component hierarchy
3. Use the `t()` function in your components to reference these keys

### 8. UI Component Organization

#### Shadcn/UI Components
The project uses shadcn/ui as its component library, which provides a set of accessible, customizable components. These components are imported directly into the project, allowing for full customization.

#### Barrel Exports
To simplify imports, UI components are re-exported from a central barrel file:
```tsx
// Import multiple components in a single import
import { Button, Card, Input, Form } from "@/components/ui";
```

#### Theming
The application uses a consistent theming approach:
1. **Tailwind CSS** for styling with utility classes
2. **next-themes** for light/dark mode support
3. **Theme tokens** in `lib/theme.ts` for consistent spacing, typography, and colors

Example usage of theme tokens:
```tsx
import { text, spacing, radius } from "@/lib/theme";

// Using theme tokens in components
<div className={`${spacing.md} ${radius.lg}`}>
  <h2 className={text.xl}>Heading</h2>
</div>;
```

### 9. Data Fetching Architecture

The project follows Next.js 13+ App Router best practices for data management:

#### Server Components (Recommended Approach)
For initial page loads and static/dynamic data that doesn't require user interaction:
```tsx
// In a Server Component (app/events/page.tsx)
import { getEvents } from "@/lib/db/events";

export default async function EventsPage() {
  // Fetch events using the cached data function
  const events = await getEvents();

  return <EventList events={events} />;
}
```

#### Server Actions
For data mutations and form submissions:
```tsx
// Import the server action
import { createEvent } from "@/app/actions";

// Use in a client component form
<form action={createEvent}>
  <input name="name" />
  <input name="location" />
  <button type="submit">Create Event</button>
</form>;
```

#### Client Components
For client-side interactive features:
```tsx
"use client";

import { useState } from "react";
import { createEvent } from "@/app/actions";

export function EventForm() {
  const [name, setName] = useState("");

  // Form with client-side validation
  return (
    <form
      action={async (formData) => {
        // Validate form data client-side
        if (!name) return;

        // Submit using server action
        const result = await createEvent(formData);

        // Handle result
        if (result.success) {
          // Success handling
        }
      }}
    >
      <input
        name="name"
        value={name}
        onChange={(e) => setName(e.target.value)}
      />
      <button type="submit">Create Event</button>
    </form>
  );
}
```

### 10. Authentication System

The project implements a robust authentication system:

```typescript
// Check if user is authenticated
const isLoggedIn = isAuthenticated();

// Attempt to login

## Lessons Learned and Concluding Remarks

### Technical Journey
Our journey with EventHub has been a deep dive into modern web technologies. Working with Next.js App Router was particularly enlightening - we discovered the power of server components for performance optimization, mastered server actions for seamless form handling, and developed efficient data fetching strategies that significantly improved our application's responsiveness.

The real-time features presented both challenges and opportunities. Implementing WebSocket-based communication required careful consideration of concurrent connections and data synchronization. Through trial and error, we developed robust strategies that now power our live event features, from real-time attendance tracking to instant Q&A sessions.

Our database architecture evolved significantly throughout the project. Working with Prisma ORM and PostgreSQL, we designed and refined our database schemas to handle complex relationships efficiently. The experience taught us valuable lessons about data modeling and query optimization that will serve us well in future projects.

Cloud integration was another area of significant learning. We successfully integrated multiple Google Cloud services, developing efficient resource management strategies and implementing secure file storage solutions. This experience gave us practical insights into cloud architecture and security best practices.

### Team Experience
Collaboration was at the heart of our success. We established effective Git workflows that kept our development process smooth, implemented regular code reviews that improved our code quality, and maintained clear communication channels that enhanced our productivity. These practices became the foundation of our team's workflow.

Our development process was guided by agile methodology, which proved particularly effective for feature development. Continuous integration helped us maintain code stability, while regular testing prevented major issues from reaching production. This systematic approach allowed us to deliver features reliably while maintaining high code quality.

Documentation played a crucial role in our project's success. We created comprehensive documentation that helped new team members get up to speed quickly, established clear guidelines that maintained code consistency, and kept our documentation updated to reflect the project's evolution. This attention to documentation proved invaluable for both development and maintenance.

### Looking Ahead
While we're proud of what we've accomplished, we see many opportunities for improvement. On the technical side, we're planning to implement more advanced caching strategies, expand our test coverage, and enhance our real-time features with additional functionality.

User experience remains a priority, with plans to add more customization options, implement advanced analytics, and further improve mobile responsiveness. We're also focusing on infrastructure improvements, including more robust monitoring, automated scaling capabilities, and enhanced security measures.

### Final Thoughts
Building EventHub has been an intense but incredibly rewarding experience for all four of us. With only a short amount of time, we came together, learned fast, and built a fully functional platform from scratch using a modern, production-ready tech stack. It wasn't always easyâ€”juggling real-time features, cloud integration, and a growing codebaseâ€”but every challenge pushed us to grow as developers and teammates.

This project gave us a chance to apply what we've learned in a real-world setting, and more importantly, to collaborate, adapt, and ship something we're genuinely proud of. It's been a great opportunity to explore cutting-edge tools like Next.js App Router, Prisma, PostgreSQL, and Google Cloud, all while learning how to build scalable, maintainable, and user-friendly software.

We're really grateful for the chance to work on this as a team. Even as this project is wrapping up, the lessons and memories we've gained will stay with us long after. And who knows? This might just be the beginning for EventHub. :3
